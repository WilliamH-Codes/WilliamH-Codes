# Hey, I’m William! 👋

I’m a 23-year-old Computer Science grad from a small town, grinding my way into a Python dev career. Armed with a B.S. and a passion for coding, I’m here building web apps, tools, and whatever else I can dream up. My mission? Sharpen my skills, land a remote gig, and show the world what `WilliamH-Codes` can do.

## About Me
- **Born**: 2002—Gen Z hustle, Gen X roots (shoutout to Dad!).
- **Degree**: B.S. in Computer Science—book smarts meet real-world grit.
- **Vibe**: Problem-solver, code tinkerer, and a sucker for a good challenge.
- **Currently**: Coding daily, dodging meat department doom, and chasing dev dreams.

## What I’m Into
- **Python**: My main squeeze—Flask, automation, you name it.
- **Skills**: Algorithms (LeetCode junkie), Git, HTML/CSS basics, and a thirst to grow.

## My Projects
Here’s what I’ve been cooking up:  
- **[William’s Task Manager](https://github.com/WilliamH-Codes/william-task-manager)**: Flask-powered to-do app—organizing life, one task at a time.  
- **[Job Scraper for William](https://github.com/WilliamH-Codes/william-job-scraper)**: Python scraper for job listings—hunting my next move.  
- **[William’s Finance Tracker](https://github.com/WilliamH-Codes/william-finance-tracker)**: Cash flow tracker—because bills don’t pay themselves.  
*(More in the pipeline—stay tuned!)*

## Goals
- Score a remote Junior Python Developer role—small town, big ambition.
- Stack certs (PCAP’s first, AWS on deck).
- Dive into open source and level up my game.

## Fun Facts
- Gaming’s my reset—check my Discord bot project soon!
- Coffee’s my co-pilot—black, strong, like my debug skills.


## Let’s Connect
- **Email**: [william@cybersentrysolutions.com]—open to chats, gigs, or collabs.  
- **Status**: Ready for remote work, freelance, or just nerding out over code.
